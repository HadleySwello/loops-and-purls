2. Explanations of the technologies used
  1. Handlebars
  2. Javascript
  3. JQuery

3. A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took
  I created a dynamically generated chart using a table which I nested a form inside of. Using handlebars I rendered it and then used it to submit the charts that people create. I also used tabs to create the multiple views on my page and allow people to navigate between different divs with ease. This is all connected to an Rails API I build and will link to further down in this READEME.

4. Installation instructions for any dependencies
  1. Fork Repo
  2. Clone to local folder
  3. NPM install

5. User stories
  1. As a signed in user I want to be able to save my patterns so I can come back to them later.
  2. As a signed in user I want to be able to edit my patterns name and have the changes save to my account.
  3. As a signed in user I want to be able to see all my patterns listed.
  4. As a signed in user I want to be able to delete patterns I don’t like anymore.
  5. (IN PROGRESS) As a user of any type I want to be able to print my pattern so I can work off of it without needing my computer right there.
  6. (IN PROGRESS) As a signed-in user I want to be able to see patterns other people have made.
  7. (IN PROGRESS) As a user I want to be able to compile my graph into a paragraph form to make reading my pattern easier.

6. Wireframes – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application

8. Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome
  So there are more than a few things I am still working on. Firstly I want to be able to compile a paragraph of the inputs from your graph. Then I want to write code so that when you save your pattern it saves as an img that you can download and print out so that you don't need to screen shot your pattern yourself. Then I want to add in option for the chart size so you can customise exactly how big you'd like your chart to be.
  Finnaly I would like to add in a feature that allows you to look at and download other peoples patterns so it becomes more of a social pattern sharing app.
