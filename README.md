3. A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took
  I created a dynamically generated chart using a table which I nested a form inside of. Using handlebars I rendered it and then used it to submit the charts that people create. I also used tabs to create the multiple views on my page and allow people to navigate between different divs with ease. This is all connected to an Rails API I build and will link to further down in this READEME.
